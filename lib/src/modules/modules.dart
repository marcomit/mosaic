/// Base class for application modules with comprehensive lifecycle management.
///
/// Modules represent isolated features or sections of an application that can
/// be independently managed, activated, and disposed. Each module has its own
/// dependency injection container and internal navigation stack.
///
/// ## Lifecycle
///
/// Modules follow a strict lifecycle:
/// 1. **Created** - Module instance exists but is uninitialized
/// 2. **Initializing** - [onInit] is being called
/// 3. **Active** - Module is ready and can be used
/// 4. **Suspended** - Module is temporarily inactive
/// 5. **Disposing** - [onDispose] is being called
/// 6. **Disposed** - Module is permanently shut down
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```dart
/// class UserModule extends Module {
///   UserModule() : super(name: 'user');
///
///   @override
///   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
///     return UserHomePage();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Future<void> onInit() async {
///     await setupUserServices();
///     await loadUserPreferences();
///   }
///
///   @override
///   Future<void> onDispose() async {
///     await saveUserState();
///     await cleanupConnections();
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Error Handling
///
/// Modules automatically handle errors during lifecycle transitions and
/// provide recovery mechanisms. Override [onError] to implement custom
/// error handling strategies.
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// All module operations are thread-safe and can be called from any isolate.
/// Internal state changes are synchronized to prevent race conditions.

  /// Creates a new module with the specified configuration.
