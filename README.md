# mosaic
Mosaic is a modular Flutter architecture that enables clean separation of features using dynamic modules, internal event systems, UI injection, and centralized build orchestration. It helps large apps scale with ease by treating each feature as an isolated unit that can be enabled, built, and tested independently.
